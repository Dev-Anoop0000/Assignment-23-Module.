// This is answer 2 of operator question.....
// In this question use of all operators.....

let Que_2 =`Question-2 :-  Write a program to perform all the arithmetic operations[except increment and decrement operators] of javascript of any two numbers stored in the variables num1 and num2. Also, print the results to the console.`;
console.log(Que_2);
let Ans_2 = "Answer-2 :- ";
console.log(Ans_2);
let num1 = 50;
let num2 = 10;

// Addition (+): Add two value together...
console.log("The Addition of num1 and num2 is = ",(num1 + num2));

// Subtraction (-): Subtraction one value from another.....
console.log("The Subtration of num1 from num2 is = ",(num1 - num2));

// Multiplication(*): Multiplies tow values togather...
console.log("The Multiplication of num1 into num2 is = ",(num1 * num2));

// Division(/); Divides one value by another value......
console.log("The Division of num1 by num2 is = ",(num1 / num2));

// Modulus(%): Return the remainder of a division operator..
console.log("The Result of modulus operaton num1 and num2 is = ",(num1 % num2));

//Exponentiation(**): Raise to the power of....
console.log("The Exponential of num1 and num2 is = ",(num1 ** num2));

// End of Answer -2 .........
